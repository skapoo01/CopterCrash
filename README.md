Copter Crash

![picutre](/src/images/copter-home.png)

A twist on the classic Helicopter Game built using Java Swing in fulfilment
of a project for Tufts COMP 86 - Graphical User Interfaces. This project was
an exploration into making intuitive and usable user interfaces, as well
as a forray into the defining game of my childhood!

In this take of the Helicopter Game, the helicopter has to dodge lazers in
addition to the obstacle it typically faces. Ever few minutes, the difficulty
level increases, as you are ambushed with lazers faster and faster.

Features of this project include:

* Random terrain generation
* Score Tracking (see if you can beat the highest score!)
* Retro/Vintage animations (made with love using Adobe Illustrator)
